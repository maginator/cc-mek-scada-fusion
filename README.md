## Quick Start

### ⚡ Super Simple Installation (Recommended)

1. **Download the installer:**
   ```lua
   pastebin get <pastebin-id> installer
   ```

2. **Run the installer:**
   ```lua
   installer
   ```

3. **Choose Quick Setup:**
   - The installer automatically detects your hardware
   - Determines the best SCADA role for this computer
   - Installs components to `/scada/` directory for easy management
   - Creates uninstall and status commands automatically
   - **That's it!** Your SCADA system is ready to use.

### Installation Workflows

When you run `installer`, you get three options:

#### **[*] Quick Setup (Recommended)**
- **Automatic hardware detection** - scans for monitors, modems, and Mekanism devices
- **Smart role assignment** - determines if this should be Server, Control Station, or Monitor
- **Zero configuration** - sets up everything with optimal defaults
- **Clean installation** - all files go to `/scada/` directory for easy management

#### **[G] Graphical Installer**
- **Visual interface** with mouse/touch controls (ComputerCraft compatible)
- **Interactive component browser** - see what each component does
- **Hardware scan visualization** - graphical display of detected equipment
- **Progress tracking** - real-time installation progress

#### **[A] Advanced Setup**
- **Manual component selection** - choose exactly what to install
- **Custom configuration** - modify network channels and settings
- **Expert mode** - for users who know exactly what they want

### Computer Roles

The installer automatically determines the best role for each computer based on connected hardware:

| Role | Description | Hardware Requirements |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| **[S] SCADA Server** | Central control hub | Wireless modem |
| **[C] Control Station** | Operator interface | Monitor + wireless modem |
| **[M] Monitor Station** | Equipment monitoring | Cable modem (connected to Mekanism) + wireless modem |
| **[H] Data Logger** | Historical data storage | Wireless modem + storage space |

### Manual Installation (Advanced)

If you need to install specific components manually:

```lua
installer server          # SCADA server only
installer control         # Control station setup  
installer monitor         # Monitoring station setup
installer gui             # Install GUI then launch graphical installer
```

### Traditional Component Installation

For experts who want specific components:

```lua
installer hmi             # Human Machine Interface
installer rtu             # Universal auto-detecting RTU
installer reactor         # Dedicated reactor RTU
installer energy          # Dedicated energy RTU
installer fuel            # Dedicated fuel RTU
installer laser           # Dedicated laser RTU
installer historian       # Data historian
```

## Management Commands

After installation, the following management commands are available:

```lua
scada_status              # Check installation status and show file information
scada_uninstall           # Safely remove all SCADA components with backup
```

### Clean Installation Structure

All SCADA components are installed to `/scada/` directory:
- **Easy management** - all files in one location
- **Safe uninstallation** - automatic backup before removal
- **Status checking** - view installed components and configuration
- **No root clutter** - keeps computer root directory clean

### Uninstallation

To completely remove the SCADA system:

```lua
scada_uninstall
```

This will:
1. Create a backup of all SCADA files
2. Remove the `/scada/` directory
3. Remove startup script and management commands
4. Show backup location for recovery if needed

### Traditional Setup (Dedicated RTUs)

For dedicated RTU computers, use specific components:
